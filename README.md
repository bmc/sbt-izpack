IzPack SBT Plugin
=================

# Introduction

This project contains an [IzPack][izpack] plugin for [SBT][sbt] 0.10.1 or
greater.

# Fork

This is a fork of the original author [located here](https://github.com/bmc/sbt-izpack/).  
It has only one difference.  It implements a new element called **fset**.  Instead of the
original **fileset** element who does have logic for finding files, it delegates all the
hard work to **IzPack**.

The syntax is:

    fset:
        # The directory where to search source files.  All paths in "includes" and "excludes"
        # are relative to this.
        dir: /mypath
        # Directory where to install the files
        targetdir: $INSTALLPATH/destinationFolder
        # Include several patterns that may use ** and *, separated by spaces or commas.  If omitted, include all files
        includes: *.jar, **/*/*.class
        # Same syntax as "includes".  Excludes are processed after includes.
        excludes: .svn/**, **/Test*

See original [IzPack documentation](http://izpack.org/documentation/installation-files.html#fileset-add-a-fileset), 
for further details about IzPack's `fileset`.

[This issue](https://github.com/bmc/sbt-izpack/issues/13) explains the motivation of this fork.

# Use

In order to use this plugin, add this line to `build.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("com.github.dapeca" % "sbt-izpack" % "1.0.3")

# variablesExportPrefixes

The original version of this plugin exports to `IzPack` many variables when building the `izpack.xml` file.

It may seem inofensive, but `IzPack` replaces in file names any $ followed by a matched variable name.

Let's look at an example.  Suppose, you have a variable called `Memory`, and a class called `MemoryLimit` that is nested to class `Settings`.
In that case, `Settings$MemoryLimit.class` would be generated after compilation and `$Memory` replaced by IzPack in the file name.

Languages like Scala use a lot of nested classes.

If the value of the `MemoryLimit` variable is `20`, the the file would be renamed to `Settings$20.class`, and a `ClassNotFound` exception would be thrown at runtime.

For avoiding this, I use a prefix to all the variables name that must be processed by IzPack and `parsable` entries, i.e. the prefix `izPack`.
 
In that case, the setting would be declared in `build.sbt` as:

    variablesExportPrefixes in IzPack := Seq("izPack")
